# React Concepts Demo App

This project is a comprehensive React application demonstrating key React concepts and features. It's built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS to provide a visually appealing and functional user interface.

## Features and React Concepts Covered

1. **Virtual DOM**: Demonstrated throughout the app's efficient rendering.
2. **State Management**:
   - Using hooks (`useState`) in functional components
   - Class component state in the Timer component
3. **Props**: Passed between parent and child components
4. **JSX**: Used in all component rendering
5. **Components**:
   - Functional Components (Counter, UserList, Form)
   - Class Component (Timer)
6. **Lifecycle Methods**: Demonstrated in the Timer class component
7. **Fragments**: Used to group multiple elements
8. **Event Handlers**: Implemented in various components (e.g., button clicks, form submissions)

## Components

1. **Counter**: A functional component demonstrating state management with hooks and event handling.
2. **Timer**: A class component showcasing lifecycle methods and state management.
3. **UserList**: A functional component that likely demonstrates working with arrays and rendering lists.
4. **Form**: A form component showing controlled inputs and form submission handling.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:
